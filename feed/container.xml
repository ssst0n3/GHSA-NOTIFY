      <title>Moby firewalld reload removes bridge network isolation</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vq8-7jfc-9cvp</link>
      <description>Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (dockerd), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as Docker, or Docker Engine.&#xA;&#xA;Firewalld is a daemon used by some Linux distributions to provide a dynamically managed firewall. When Firewalld is running, Docker uses its iptables backend to create rules, including rules to isolate containers in one bridge network from containers in other bridge networks.&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;The iptables rules created by Docker are removed when firewalld is reloaded using, for example &#34;firewall-cmd --reload&#34;, &#34;killall -HUP firewalld&#34;, or &#34;systemctl reload firewalld&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;When that happens, Docker must re-create the rules. However, in affected versions of Docker, the iptables rules that isolate containers in different bridge networks from each other are not re-created.&#xA;&#xA;Once these rules have been removed, containers have access to any port, on any container, in any non-internal bridge network, running on the Docker host.&#xA;&#xA;Containers running in networks created with `--internal` or equivalent have no access to other networks. Containers that are only connected to these networks remain isolated after a firewalld reload.&#xA;&#xA;Where Docker Engine is not running in the host&#39;s network namespace, it is unaffected. Including, for example, Rootless Mode, and Docker Desktop.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;Moby releases 28.0.0 and newer are not affected. A fix is available in moby release 25.0.13.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;After reloading firewalld, either:&#xA;- Restart the docker daemon,&#xA;- Re-create bridge networks, or&#xA;- Use rootless mode.&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;https://firewalld.org/&#xA;https://firewalld.org/documentation/howto/reload-firewalld.html</description>

      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v23v-6jw2-98fq</link>
      <description>A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass [authorization plugins (AuthZ)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low. This advisory outlines the issue, identifies the affected versions, and provides remediation steps for impacted users.&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an [authorization plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/) without the body.

      <title>Container build can leak any path on the host into the container</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25</link>
      <description>### Description&#xA;&#xA;Moby is the open source Linux container runtime and set of components used to build a variety of downstream container runtimes, including Docker CE, Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker EE), and Docker Desktop. Moby allows for building container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to as a &#34;Dockerfile&#34;), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which the Dockerfile instructions are executed.&#xA;&#xA;Containers may be built using a variety of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.&#xA;&#xA;Versions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.&#xA;&#xA;This issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;This vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.&#xA;&#xA;As this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;Moby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of `git+&lt;protocol&gt;://...` URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.&#xA;&#xA;Specifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:&#xA;&#xA;* `docker build` with the legacy builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.&#xA;* `docker build` with the BuildKit builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) of a Git URL context.&#xA;* `docker buildx build` with `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` of a Git URL context.&#xA;&#xA;Patches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.&#xA;&#xA;Patches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose **cannot** fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as `git clone --recursive`, `git submodule update`, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;While this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution. Users should not build a repository/build context they do not trust, as containerization cannot protect against all possible attacks.&#xA;&#xA;When building with BuildKit (e.g. `docker buildx build` or `docker build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`), this issue cannot be exploited unless `--build-arg BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` was also passed, as by default BuildKit will discard the `.git` directory of a Git URL context immediately after cloning and checking out the repository.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)&#xA;* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com)</description>

      <title>Docker supplementary group permissions not set up properly, allowing attackers to bypass primary group restrictions</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4</link>
      <description>Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Users should update to this version when it is available. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `&#34;USER $USERNAME&#34;` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [&#34;su&#34;, &#34;-&#34;, &#34;user&#34;]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Steven Murdoch for reporting this issue.&#xA;&#xA;----&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. &#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA; This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18.

      <title>Moby (Docker Engine) is vulnerable to Ambiguous OCI manifest parsing</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;In the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior and in the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 and prior, manifest and index documents are ambiguous without an accompanying Content-Type HTTP header.  Versions of Moby (Docker Engine) prior to 20.10.11 treat the Content-Type header as trusted and deserialize the document according to that header.  If the Content-Type header changed between pulls of the same ambiguous document (with the same digest), the document may be interpreted differently, meaning that the digest alone is insufficient to unambiguously identify the content of the image.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;This issue has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.11.  Image pulls for manifests that contain a “manifests” field or indices which contain a “layers” field are rejected.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;Ensure you only pull images from trusted sources.&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-mc8v-mgrf-8f4m&#xA;https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-77vh-xpmg-72qh&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;* [Open an issue in](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)&#xA;* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com)&#xA;</description>

      <description>## Impact&#xA;&#xA;A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs.  When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs.  When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed.&#xA;&#xA;## Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;Limit access to the host to trusted users.

      <title>Moby (Docker Engine) started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.  Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container&#39;s bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.&#xA;&#xA;This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container&#39;s bounding set.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.&#xA;&#xA;This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container&#39;s bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container&#39;s bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container&#39;s bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;&#xA;The Moby project would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [Moby security policy](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/SECURITY.md).&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)&#xA;* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com) if you think you’ve found a security bug</description>

      <title>IPv6 enabled on IPv4-only network interfaces</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9</link>
      <description>In 26.0.0 and 26.0.1, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`.&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;A container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, with IPv6 enabled:&#xA;&#xA;- Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses.&#xA;- If router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses.&#xA;- The interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups.&#xA;&#xA;This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface.&#xA;&#xA;A container with an unexpected IPv6 address can do anything a container configured with an IPv6 address can do. That is, listen for connections on its IPv6 address, open connections to other nodes on the network over IPv6, or attempt a DoS attack by flooding packets from its IPv6 address. This has CVSS score AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L (2.7).&#xA;&#xA;Because the container may not be constrained by an IPv6 firewall, there is increased potential for data exfiltration from the container. This has CVSS score AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (4.7).&#xA;&#xA;A remote attacker could send malicious Router Advertisements to divert traffic to itself, a black-hole, or another device. The same attack is possible today for IPv4 macvlan/ipvlan endpoints with ARP spoofing, TLS is commonly used by Internet APIs to mitigate this risk. The presence of an IPv6 route could impact the container&#39;s availability by indirectly abusing the behaviour of software which behaves poorly in a dual-stack environment. For example, it could resolve a name to a DNS AAAA record and keep trying to connect over IPv6 without ever falling back to IPv4, potentially denying service to the container. This has CVSS score AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (4.5).&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;The issue is patched in 26.0.2.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file, the equivalent:&#xA;&#xA;```&#xA;        sysctls:&#xA;            - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;&#xA;- sysctl configuration using `docker run`:&#xA;  - https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#sysctl&#xA;- sysctl configuration using `docker compose`:&#xA;  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#sysctls</description>

      <title>Moby&#39;s external DNS requests from &#39;internal&#39; networks could lead to data exfiltration</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx</link>
      <description>Moby is an open source container framework originally developed by Docker Inc. as Docker. It is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. As a batteries-included container runtime, Moby comes with a built-in networking implementation that enables communication between containers, and between containers and external resources.&#xA;&#xA;Moby&#39;s networking implementation allows for creating and using many networks, each with their own subnet and gateway. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters, and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.&#xA;&#xA;When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses (typically from a non-routable [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) subnet). The root network namespace (hereafter referred to as the &#39;host&#39;) serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.&#xA;&#xA;Containers on an _internal_ network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.&#xA;&#xA;In addition to configuring the Linux kernel&#39;s various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery (looking up other containers on the network by name), and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.&#xA;&#xA;When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver (by default, the host&#39;s configured resolver). This request is made from the container network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.&#xA;&#xA;As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to _internal_ network(s) will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.&#xA;&#xA;Many systems will run a local forwarding DNS resolver, typically present on a loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8`), such as systemd-resolved or dnsmasq. Common loopback address examples include `127.0.0.1` or `127.0.0.53`. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host&#39;s configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device.&#xA;&#xA;To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` will detect this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host/root network namespace. The loopback resolver will then forward the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.&#xA;&#xA;## Impact&#xA;&#xA;Because `dockerd` will forward DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace&#39;s normal routing semantics entirely, _internal_ networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver.&#xA;&#xA;By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers. For example, if the domain `evil.example` was registered, the authoritative nameserver(s) for that domain could (eventually and indirectly) receive a request for `this-is-a-secret.evil.example`.&#xA;&#xA;Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;&#xA;Moby releases 26.0.0-rc3, 25.0.5 (released) and 23.0.11 (to be released) are patched to prevent forwarding DNS requests from internal networks.&#xA;&#xA;## Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;-   Run containers intended to be solely attached to _internal_ networks with a custom upstream address (`--dns` argument to `docker run`, or API equivalent), which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container network namespace.&#xA;&#xA;## Background&#xA;&#xA;- yair zak originally reported this issue to the Docker security team.&#xA;-  PR &lt;https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609&gt; was opened in public to fix this issue, as it was not originally considered to have a security implication.&#xA;- [The official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/ipvlan/#:~:text=If%20the%20parent,the%20network%20completely) claims that &#34;the `--internal` flag that will completely isolate containers on a network from any communications external to that network,&#34; which necessitated this advisory and CVE.</description>

The loopback resolver will then forward the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.&#xA;&#xA;## Impact&#xA;&#xA;Because `dockerd` will forward DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace&#39;s normal routing semantics entirely, _internal_ networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver.&#xA;&#xA;By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers. For example, if the domain `evil.example` was registered, the authoritative nameserver(s) for that domain could (eventually and indirectly) receive a request for `this-is-a-secret.evil.example`.&#xA;&#xA;Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;&#xA;Moby releases 26.0.0-rc3, 25.0.5 (released) and 23.0.11 (to be released) are patched to prevent forwarding DNS requests from internal networks.&#xA;&#xA;## Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;-   Run containers intended to be solely attached to _internal_ networks with a custom upstream address (`--dns` argument to `docker run`, or API equivalent), which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container network namespace.&#xA;&#xA;## Background&#xA;&#xA;- yair zak originally reported this issue to the Docker security team.&#xA;-  PR &lt;https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609&gt; was opened in public to fix this issue, as it was not originally considered to have a security implication.&#xA;- [The official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/ipvlan/#:~:text=If%20the%20parent,the%20network%20completely) claims that &#34;the `--internal` flag that will completely isolate containers on a network from any communications external to that network,&#34; which necessitated this advisory and CVE.</description>

      <title>Classic builder cache poisoning</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xw73-rw38-6vjc</link>
      <description>The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built `FROM scratch`.&#xA;Also, changes to some instructions (most important being `HEALTHCHECK` and `ONBUILD`) would not cause a cache miss.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps.&#xA;&#xA;For example, an attacker could create an image that is considered as a valid cache candidate for:&#xA;```&#xA;FROM scratch&#xA;MAINTAINER Pawel&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;when in fact the malicious image used as a cache would be an image built from a different Dockerfile.&#xA;&#xA;In the second case, the attacker could for example substitute a different `HEALTCHECK` command.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` environment variable) or are using the `/build` API endpoint (which uses the classic builder by default).&#xA;&#xA;All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. An example could be a CI with a shared cache, or just a regular Docker user pulling a malicious image due to misspelling/typosquatting.&#xA;&#xA;Image build API endpoint (`/build`) and `ImageBuild` function from `github.com/docker/docker/client` is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;Patches are included in Moby releases:&#xA;&#xA;- v25.0.2&#xA;- v24.0.9&#xA;- v23.0.10&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;- Use `--no-cache` or use Buildkit if possible (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`, it&#39;s default on 23.0+ assuming that the buildx plugin is installed).&#xA;- Use `Version = types.BuilderBuildKit` or `NoCache = true` in `ImageBuildOptions` for `ImageBuild` call.&#xA;&#xA;</description>

      <description>In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret.</description>

      <title>Docker Swarm encrypted overlay network may be unauthenticated</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp</link>
      <description>[Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.&#xA;&#xA;Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.&#xA;&#xA;The `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.&#xA;&#xA;Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.&#xA;&#xA;When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet&#39;s VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.&#xA;&#xA;[Two iptables rules](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L230-L234) serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the `INPUT` filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.&#xA;&#xA;On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:&#xA;* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)&#xA;* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)&#xA;* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)&#xA;&#xA;These rules are not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.&#xA;&#xA;## Impact&#xA;Encrypted overlay networks on affected configurations silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams.&#xA;&#xA;The injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime&#39;s 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.&#xA;&#xA;## Workarounds&#xA;* Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary (see [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)) to prevent all VXLAN packet injection.&#xA;* Ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.&#xA;&#xA;## Background&#xA;* [#43382](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382) partially discussed this concern, but did not consider the security implications.&#xA;* Mirantis FIELD-5788 essentially duplicates [#43382](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382), and was created six months earlier; it similarly overlooked the security implications.&#xA;* [#45118](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118) is the ancestor of the final patches, and was where the security implications were discovered.&#xA;&#xA;## Related&#xA;* [CVE-2023-28841: Encrypted overlay network traffic may be unencrypted](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237)&#xA;* [CVE-2023-28842: Encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p)&#xA;* [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw: The Swarm VXLAN port may be exposed to attack due to ambiguous documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)&#xA;* [GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333: Security issues in encrypted overlay networks](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333) (libnetwork)</description>

Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.&#xA;&#xA;On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:&#xA;* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)&#xA;* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)&#xA;* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)&#xA;&#xA;These rules are not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.&#xA;&#xA;## Impact&#xA;Encrypted overlay networks on affected configurations silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network.

      <description>[Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.&#xA;&#xA;Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.&#xA;&#xA;The `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.&#xA;&#xA;Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.&#xA;&#xA;When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec.

      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;A bug was found in containerd&#39;s CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. &#xA;&#xA;Repetitive calls of CRI Attach (e.g., [`kubectl attach`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_attach/)) could increase the memory usage of containerd.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions:&#xA;&#xA;* 2.2.0&#xA;* 2.1.5&#xA;* 2.0.7&#xA;* 1.7.29&#xA;&#xA;Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;Set up an admission controller to control accesses to `pods/attach` resources.&#xA;e.g., [Validating Admission Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;&#xA;The containerd project would like to thank @Wheat2018 for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;&#xA;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-64329&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)&#xA;* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)&#xA;&#xA;To report a security issue in containerd:&#xA;&#xA;* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)</description>

      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwhc-rpq9-4c8w</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;An overly broad default permission vulnerability was found in containerd.&#xA;&#xA;- `/var/lib/containerd` was created with the permission bits 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700&#xA;  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the metadata store and the content store&#xA;- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` was created with 0o755, while it should be created with 0o700&#xA;  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the contents of Kubernetes local volumes. The contents of volumes might include setuid binaries, which could allow a local user on the host to elevate privileges on the host.&#xA;- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` was created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700&#xA;&#xA;The directory paths may differ depending on the daemon configuration.&#xA;When the `temp` directory path is specified in the daemon configuration, that directory was also created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions:&#xA;&#xA;* 2.2.0&#xA;* 2.1.5&#xA;* 2.0.7&#xA;* 1.7.29&#xA;&#xA;Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.&#xA;These updates automatically change the permissions of the existing directories.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; [!NOTE]&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; `/run/containerd` and `/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task` are still created with 0o711.&#xA;&gt; This is an expected behavior for supporting userns-remapped containers.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;The system administrator on the host can manually chmod the directories to not &#xA;have group or world accessible permisisons:&#xA;&#xA;```&#xA;chmod 700 /var/lib/containerd&#xA;chmod 700 /run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri&#xA;chmod 700 /run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;An alternative mitigation would be to run containerd in [rootless mode](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/rootless.md).&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;&#xA;The containerd project would like to thank David Leadbeater for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)&#xA;* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)&#xA;&#xA;To report a security issue in containerd:&#xA;&#xA;* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)</description>

      <title>containerd started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9cp-9c75-9v8c</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;A bug was found in containerd where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.  Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container&#39;s bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.&#xA;&#xA;This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container&#39;s bounding set.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.11 and 1.6.2.  Users should update to these versions as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.&#xA;&#xA;This fix changes containerd behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container&#39;s bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container&#39;s bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container&#39;s bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* [Open an issue](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new)&#xA;* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io) if you think you’ve found a security bug</description>

      <title>containerd allows RAPL to be accessible to a container</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c</link>
      <description># /sys/devices/virtual/powercap accessible by default to containers&#xA;&#xA;Intel&#39;s RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.&#xA;&#xA;By 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization).

      <title>containerd allows RAPL to be accessible to a container</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c</link>
      <description># /sys/devices/virtual/powercap accessible by default to containers&#xA;&#xA;Intel&#39;s RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.&#xA;&#xA;By 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).&#xA;&#xA;Several mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10.

      <title>containerd-shim API Exposed to Host Network Containers</title>

      <description>## Impact&#xA;&#xA;Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges.&#xA;&#xA;### Specific Go Packages Affected&#xA;github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;&#xA;This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3.

      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mvff-h3cj-wj9c</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;Containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux systems which use the SELinux security module and containerd versions since v1.5.0 can cause arbitrary files and directories on the host to be relabeled to match the container process label through the use of specially-configured bind mounts in a hostPath volume. This relabeling elevates permissions for the container, granting full read/write access over the affected files and directories. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation.&#xA;&#xA;If you are not using containerd’s CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not affected by this issue.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.9.  Because file labels persist independently of containerd, users should both update to these versions as soon as they are released and validate that all files on their host are correctly labeled.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;Ensure that no sensitive files or directories are used as a hostPath volume source location.  Policy enforcement mechanisms such a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy [AllowedHostPaths](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#volumes-and-file-systems) may be specified to limit the files and directories that can be bind-mounted to containers.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)&#xA;* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)</description>

      <title>containerd v1.2.x can be coerced into leaking credentials during image pull</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-742w-89gc-8m9c</link>
      <description>## Impact&#xA;&#xA;If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers.&#xA;&#xA;If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user&#39;s username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account.&#xA;&#xA;The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it.&#xA;&#xA;This vulnerability has been rated by the containerd maintainers as medium, with a CVSS score of 6.1 and a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.&#xA;&#xA;## Patches&#xA;&#xA;This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14.  containerd 1.3 and later are not affected.&#xA;&#xA;## Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;If you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected.  If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources.  Other container runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are not affected.&#xA;&#xA;## Credits&#xA;&#xA;The containerd maintainers would like to thank Brad Geesaman, Josh Larsen, Ian Coldwater, Duffie Cooley, and Rory McCune for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/SECURITY.md).</description>

      <title>runc container escape and denial of service due to arbitrary write gadgets and procfs write redirects</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm</link>
      <description>### Impact ###&#xA;&#xA;This attack is primarily a more sophisticated version of CVE-2019-19921, which was a flaw which allowed an attacker to trick runc into writing the LSM process labels for a container process into a dummy `tmpfs` file and thus not apply the correct LSM labels to the container process. The mitigation runc applied for CVE-2019-19921 was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when runc writes LSM labels that those labels are actual procfs files.&#xA;&#xA;Rather than using a fake `tmpfs` file for `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;`, an attacker could instead (through various means) make `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;` reference a real `procfs` file, but one that would still be a no-op (such as `/proc/self/sched`). This would have the same effect but would clear the &#34;is a procfs file&#34; check. Runc is aware that this kind of attack would be possible (even going so far as to discuss this publicly as &#34;future work&#34; at conferences), and runc is working on a far more comprehensive mitigation of this attack, but this security issue was disclosed before runc could complete this work.&#xA;&#xA;In all known versions of runc, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to `/proc` to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a `tmpfs` or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;` was the example used above (which is LSM-specific), this issue affect all writes to `/proc` in runc and thus also affects sysctls (written to `/proc/sys/...`) and some other APIs.&#xA;&#xA;#### Additional Impacts ####&#xA;&#xA;While investigating this issue, runc discovered that another risk with these redirected writes is that they could be redirected to dangerous files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger` rather than just no-op files like `/proc/self/sched`. For instance, the default AppArmor profile name in Docker is `docker-default`, which when written to `/proc/sysrq-trigger` would cause the host system to crash.&#xA;&#xA;When this was discovered, runc conducted an audit of other write operations within runc and found several possible areas where runc could be used as a semi-arbitrary write gadget when combined with the above race attacks. The most concerning attack scenario was the configuration of sysctls. Because the contents of the sysctl are free-form text, an attacker could use a misdirected write to write to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` and break out of the container (as described in CVE-2025-31133, kernel upcalls are not namespaced and so coredump helpers will run with complete root privileges on the host). Even if the attacker cannot configure custom sysctls, a valid sysctl string (when redirected to `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) can easily cause the machine to hang.&#xA;&#xA;Note that the fact that this attack allows you to disable LSM labels makes it a very useful attack to combine with CVE-2025-31133 (as one of the only mitigations available to most users for that issue is AppArmor, and this attack would let you bypass that). However, the misdirected write issue above means that you could also achieve most of the same goals without needing to chain together attacks.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###&#xA;&#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:&#xA;&#xA;  * CVE-2025-31133&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52881&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset. The following patches from that patchset resolve the issues in this advisory:&#xA;&#xA; * db19bbed5348 (&#34;internal/sys: add VerifyInode helper&#34;)&#xA; * 6fc191449109 (&#34;internal: move utils.MkdirAllInRoot to internal/pathrs&#34;)&#xA; * ff94f9991bd3 (&#34;*: switch to safer securejoin.Reopen&#34;)&#xA; * 44a0fcf685db (&#34;go.mod: update to github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin@v0.5.0&#34;)&#xA; * 77889b56db93 (&#34;internal: add wrappers for securejoin.Proc*&#34;)&#xA; * fdcc9d3cad2f (&#34;apparmor: use safe procfs API for labels&#34;)&#xA; * ff6fe1324663 (&#34;utils: use safe procfs for /proc/self/fd loop code&#34;)&#xA; * b3dd1bc562ed (&#34;utils: remove unneeded EnsureProcHandle&#34;)&#xA; * 77d217c7c377 (&#34;init: write sysctls using safe procfs API&#34;)&#xA; * 435cc81be6b7 (&#34;init: use securejoin for /proc/self/setgroups&#34;)&#xA; * d61fd29d854b (&#34;libct/system: use securejoin for /proc/$pid/stat&#34;)&#xA; * 4b37cd93f86e (&#34;libct: align param type for mountCgroupV1/V2 functions&#34;)&#xA; * d40b3439a961 (&#34;rootfs: switch to fd-based handling of mountpoint targets&#34;)&#xA; * ed6b1693b8b3 (&#34;selinux: use safe procfs API for labels&#34;)&#xA;   - Please note that this patch includes a private patch for `github.com/opencontainers/selinux` that could not be made public through a public pull request (as it would necessarily disclose this embargoed security issue).&#xA;&#xA;     The patch includes a complete copy of the forked code and a `replace` directive (as well as `go mod vendor` applied), which should still work with downstream build systems. If you cannot apply this patch, you can safely drop it -- some of the other patches in this series should block these kinds of racing mount attacks entirely.&#xA;&#xA;     See https://github.com/opencontainers/selinux/pull/237 for the upstream patch.&#xA; * 3f925525b44d (&#34;rootfs: re-allow dangling symlinks in mount targets&#34;)&#xA; * a41366e74080 (&#34;openat2: improve resilience on busy systems&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;runc 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3 have been released and all contain fixes for these issues. As per [runc&#39;s new release model][RELEASES.md], runc 1.1.x and earlier are no longer supported and thus have not been patched.&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2&#xA;[CVE-2025-52565]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r&#xA;[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm&#xA;[RELEASES.md]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md&#xA;&#xA;### Mitigations ###&#xA;&#xA; * Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.&#xA;&#xA; * For the basic no-op attack, this attack allows a container process to run with the same LSM labels as `runc`. For most AppArmor deployments this means it will be `unconfined`, and for SELinux it will likely be `container_runtime_t`. Runc has not conducted in-depth testing of the impact on SELinux -- it is possible that it provides some reasonable protection but it seems likely that an attacker could cause harm to systems even with such an SELinux setup.&#xA;&#xA; * For the more involved redirect and write gadget attacks, unfortunately most LSM profiles (including the standard container-selinux profiles) provide the container runtime access to sysctl files (including `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) and so LSMs likely do not provide much protection against these attacks.&#xA;&#xA; * Using rootless containers provides some protection against these kinds of bugs (privileged writes in runc being redirected) -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. For this particular bug, the privilege escalation caused by the inadvertent write issue is entirely mitigated with rootless containers because the unprivileged user that the `runc` process is executing as cannot write to the aforementioned procfs files (even intentionally).&#xA;&#xA;### Other Runtimes ###&#xA;&#xA;As this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug, runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability.&#xA;&#xA;Based on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a co-ordinated security release along with runc. LXC appears to use the host&#39;s `/proc` for all procfs operations, and so is likely not vulnerable to this issue (this is a trade-off -- runc uses the container&#39;s procfs to avoid CVE-2016-9962-style attacks).&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2016-9962]: https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jan/21&#xA;&#xA;### Credits ###&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) and Tõnis Tiigi (@tonistiigi from Docker) for both independently discovering this vulnerability, as well as Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) for the original research into this class of security issues and solutions.&#xA;&#xA;Additional thanks go to Tõnis Tiigi for finding some very useful exploit templates for these kinds of race attacks using `docker buildx build`.</description>

      <title>runc container escape and denial of service due to arbitrary write gadgets and procfs write redirects</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm</link>
      <description>### Impact ###&#xA;&#xA;This attack is primarily a more sophisticated version of CVE-2019-19921, which was a flaw which allowed an attacker to trick runc into writing the LSM process labels for a container process into a dummy `tmpfs` file and thus not apply the correct LSM labels to the container process. The mitigation runc applied for CVE-2019-19921 was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when runc writes LSM labels that those labels are actual procfs files.&#xA;&#xA;Rather than using a fake `tmpfs` file for `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;`, an attacker could instead (through various means) make `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;` reference a real `procfs` file, but one that would still be a no-op (such as `/proc/self/sched`). This would have the same effect but would clear the &#34;is a procfs file&#34; check. Runc is aware that this kind of attack would be possible (even going so far as to discuss this publicly as &#34;future work&#34; at conferences), and runc is working on a far more comprehensive mitigation of this attack, but this security issue was disclosed before runc could complete this work.&#xA;&#xA;In all known versions of runc, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to `/proc` to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a `tmpfs` or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while `/proc/self/attr/&lt;label&gt;` was the example used above (which is LSM-specific), this issue affect all writes to `/proc` in runc and thus also affects sysctls (written to `/proc/sys/...`) and some other APIs.&#xA;&#xA;#### Additional Impacts ####&#xA;&#xA;While investigating this issue, runc discovered that another risk with these redirected writes is that they could be redirected to dangerous files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger` rather than just no-op files like `/proc/self/sched`. For instance, the default AppArmor profile name in Docker is `docker-default`, which when written to `/proc/sysrq-trigger` would cause the host system to crash.&#xA;&#xA;When this was discovered, runc conducted an audit of other write operations within runc and found several possible areas where runc could be used as a semi-arbitrary write gadget when combined with the above race attacks. The most concerning attack scenario was the configuration of sysctls. Because the contents of the sysctl are free-form text, an attacker could use a misdirected write to write to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` and break out of the container (as described in CVE-2025-31133, kernel upcalls are not namespaced and so coredump helpers will run with complete root privileges on the host). Even if the attacker cannot configure custom sysctls, a valid sysctl string (when redirected to `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) can easily cause the machine to hang.&#xA;&#xA;Note that the fact that this attack allows you to disable LSM labels makes it a very useful attack to combine with CVE-2025-31133 (as one of the only mitigations available to most users for that issue is AppArmor, and this attack would let you bypass that). However, the misdirected write issue above means that you could also achieve most of the same goals without needing to chain together attacks.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###&#xA;&#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:&#xA;&#xA;  * CVE-2025-31133&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52881&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

      <title>runc container escape with malicious config due to /dev/console mount and related races</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r</link>
      <description>### Impact ###&#xA;This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). &#xA;&#xA;In runc version 1.0.0-rc3 and later, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). &#xA;&#xA;The reason that the attacker can gain write access to these files is because the `/dev/console` bind-mount happens before `maskedPaths` and `readonlyPaths` are applied.&#xA;&#xA;#### Additional Findings ####&#xA;While investigating this issue, runc discovered some other theoretical issues that may or may not be exploitable, as well as taking the opportunity to fix some fairly well-known issues related to consoles.&#xA;&#xA;##### Issue 1: Problematic Usage of `os.Create` #####&#xA;Go provides an `os.Create` function for creating files, which older code in runc (dating back to the original `libcontainer` from the early 2010s) had a tendency to use fairly liberally. `os.Create` implies `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` but by design it does not apply `O_NOFOLLOW` nor `O_EXCL`, meaning if the target is swapped with a malicious symlink runc can be tricked into truncating host files (which can lead to denial of service attacks, among other concerns). &#xA;&#xA;Runc conducted an audit of all `os.Create` usages in runc and found some suspicious usages related to device inodes, but based on runc&#39;s testing these were not exploitable in practice. Runc now has custom code lints to block any `os.Create` usage in runc, and plan to do a further audit of any other plain `os.*` operation usage throughout runc after this advisory becomes public. &#xA;&#xA;CVE-2024-45310 was a similar attack but without the `O_TRUNC` component (which resulted in a &#34;Low&#34; severity) -- a similar attack being exploitable would&#39;ve been much more severe.&#xA;&#xA;##### Issue 2: Malicious `/dev/pts/$n` Inode Attacks (`TIOCGPTPEER`) #####&#xA;The (very) classic API for constructing consoles involves first opening `/dev/ptmx` for reading and writing. This allocates a new pseudo-terminal and the returned file descriptor is the &#34;master&#34; end (which is used by higher-level runtimes to do I/O with the container). &#xA;&#xA;Traditionally, in order to get the &#34;slave&#34; end, you do `ioctl(ptm, TIOCGPTN)` to get the pseudo-terminal number and then open the file in `/dev/pts/` with the corresponding base-10 decimal number of the number returned by `TIOCGPTN`. The naive way of doing this is vulnerable to very basic race attacks where `/dev/pts/$n` is replaced with a different pseudo-terminal or other malicious file. &#xA;&#xA;In order to provide a mechanism to mitigate this risk, Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) implemented `TIOCGPTPEER` back in 2017 to provide a race-free way of doing the last `TIOCGPTN` step by opening the peer end of the pseudo-terminal directly. However, at the time it was believed to be too impractical to implement this protection in runc due to its no-monitor-process architecture (unlike runtimes like LXC which made use of `TIOCGPTPEER` almost immediately). While working on this advisory, runc found a way to make `TIOCGPTN` usage on pre-4.13 kernels still safe against race attacks and so have implemented both `TIOCGPTPEER` support as well as safe `TIOCGPTN` support as a fallback. &#xA;&#xA;Another possible target of attack would be replacing `/dev/ptmx` or `/dev/pts/ptmx` with a different inode and tricking runc into trying to operate on it. This is very similar to the core issue in CVE-2025-31133 and had a similar solution. &#xA;&#xA;Runc&#39;s analysis was that while this attack appears to be potentially problematic in theory, it seems unlikely to actually be exploitable due to how consoles are treated (runc tries to do several pseudo-terminal-specific `ioctl`s and will error out if they fail -- which happens for most other file types). In principle you could imagine a DoS attack using a disconnected NFS handle but it seems impractical to exploit. However, runc felt it prudent to include a solution (and this also provides a safe mechanism to get the source mount for the `/dev/console` bind-mount issue at the beginning of this advisory).&#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###&#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:&#xA;&#xA;  * CVE-2025-31133&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52881&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

As per [runc&#39;s new release model](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md), runc 1.1.x and earlier are no longer supported and thus have not been patched.&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2&#xA;[CVE-2025-52565]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r&#xA;[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm&#xA;[RELEASES.md]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md&#xA;&#xA;### Mitigations ###&#xA;* Use containers with user namespaces (with the host root user not mapped into the container&#39;s user namespace). This will block most of the most serious aspects of these attacks, as the `procfs` files used for the container breakout use Unix DAC permissions and user namespaced users will not have access to the relevant files. &#xA;&#xA;An attacker would still be able to bind-mount host paths into the container but if the host uids and gids mapped into the container do not overlap with ordinary users on the host (which is the generally recommended configuration) then the attacker would likely not be able to read or write to most sensitive host files (depending on the Unix DAC permissions of the host files). Note that this is still technically more privilege than an unprivileged user on the host -- because the bind-mount is done by a privileged process, the attacker would be able to get access to directories whose parents may have denied search access (i.e., they may be able to access paths inside a `chmod 700` directory that would normally block them from resolving subpaths). &#xA;&#xA;Runc would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that runc **strongly** recommend all users use user namespaced containers. They have proven to be one of the best security hardening mechanisms against container breakouts, and the kernel applies additional restrictions to user namespaced containers above and beyond the user remapping functionality provided. With the advent of id-mapped mounts (Linux 5.12), there is very little reason to not use user namespaces for most applications. Note that using user namespaces to configure your container does not mean you have to enable unprivileged user namespace creation *inside* the container -- most container runtimes apply a seccomp-bpf profile which blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` inside containers regardless of whether the container itself uses user namespaces. &#xA;&#xA;Rootless containers can provide even more protection if your configuration can use them -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. &#xA;&#xA; * For non-user namespaced containers, configure all containers you spawn to not permit processes to run with root privileges. In most cases this would require configuring the container to use a non-root user and enabling `noNewPrivileges` to disable any setuid or set-capability binaries. (Note that this is runc&#39;s general recommendation for a secure container setup -- it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an untrusted program with root privileges safely.) If you need to use `ping` in your containers, there is a `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl that can be used to allow unprivileged users to ping without requiring setuid or set-capability binaries. &#xA; * Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.&#xA; * The default `containers-selinux` SELinux policy mitigates this issue, as (unlike CVE-2025-31133) the `/dev/console` bind-mount does not get relabeled and so the container process cannot write to the bind-mounted procfs file by default.&#xA;&#xA;   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so this mitigation is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.&#xA;&#xA; * The default AppArmor policy used by Docker and Podman does not mitigate this issue (as access to `/dev/console`) is usually permitted. Users could create a custom profile that blocks access to `/dev/console`, but such a profile might break regular containers.&#xA;&#xA;   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so the mitigation provided with a custom profile is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2&#xA;[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm&#xA;&#xA;### Other Runtimes ###&#xA;As this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug,runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability.&#xA;&#xA;Based on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a co-ordinated security release along with runc.

      <description>### Impact ###&#xA;This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). &#xA;&#xA;In runc version 1.0.0-rc3 and later, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). &#xA;&#xA;The reason that the attacker can gain write access to these files is because the `/dev/console` bind-mount happens before `maskedPaths` and `readonlyPaths` are applied.&#xA;&#xA;#### Additional Findings ####&#xA;While investigating this issue, runc discovered some other theoretical issues that may or may not be exploitable, as well as taking the opportunity to fix some fairly well-known issues related to consoles.&#xA;&#xA;##### Issue 1: Problematic Usage of `os.Create` #####&#xA;Go provides an `os.Create` function for creating files, which older code in runc (dating back to the original `libcontainer` from the early 2010s) had a tendency to use fairly liberally. `os.Create` implies `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` but by design it does not apply `O_NOFOLLOW` nor `O_EXCL`, meaning if the target is swapped with a malicious symlink runc can be tricked into truncating host files (which can lead to denial of service attacks, among other concerns). &#xA;&#xA;Runc conducted an audit of all `os.Create` usages in runc and found some suspicious usages related to device inodes, but based on runc&#39;s testing these were not exploitable in practice. Runc now has custom code lints to block any `os.Create` usage in runc, and plan to do a further audit of any other plain `os.*` operation usage throughout runc after this advisory becomes public. &#xA;&#xA;CVE-2024-45310 was a similar attack but without the `O_TRUNC` component (which resulted in a &#34;Low&#34; severity) -- a similar attack being exploitable would&#39;ve been much more severe.&#xA;&#xA;##### Issue 2: Malicious `/dev/pts/$n` Inode Attacks (`TIOCGPTPEER`) #####&#xA;The (very) classic API for constructing consoles involves first opening `/dev/ptmx` for reading and writing. This allocates a new pseudo-terminal and the returned file descriptor is the &#34;master&#34; end (which is used by higher-level runtimes to do I/O with the container). &#xA;&#xA;Traditionally, in order to get the &#34;slave&#34; end, you do `ioctl(ptm, TIOCGPTN)` to get the pseudo-terminal number and then open the file in `/dev/pts/` with the corresponding base-10 decimal number of the number returned by `TIOCGPTN`. The naive way of doing this is vulnerable to very basic race attacks where `/dev/pts/$n` is replaced with a different pseudo-terminal or other malicious file. &#xA;&#xA;In order to provide a mechanism to mitigate this risk, Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) implemented `TIOCGPTPEER` back in 2017 to provide a race-free way of doing the last `TIOCGPTN` step by opening the peer end of the pseudo-terminal directly. However, at the time it was believed to be too impractical to implement this protection in runc due to its no-monitor-process architecture (unlike runtimes like LXC which made use of `TIOCGPTPEER` almost immediately). While working on this advisory, runc found a way to make `TIOCGPTN` usage on pre-4.13 kernels still safe against race attacks and so have implemented both `TIOCGPTPEER` support as well as safe `TIOCGPTN` support as a fallback. &#xA;&#xA;Another possible target of attack would be replacing `/dev/ptmx` or `/dev/pts/ptmx` with a different inode and tricking runc into trying to operate on it. This is very similar to the core issue in CVE-2025-31133 and had a similar solution. &#xA;&#xA;Runc&#39;s analysis was that while this attack appears to be potentially problematic in theory, it seems unlikely to actually be exploitable due to how consoles are treated (runc tries to do several pseudo-terminal-specific `ioctl`s and will error out if they fail -- which happens for most other file types). In principle you could imagine a DoS attack using a disconnected NFS handle but it seems impractical to exploit. However, runc felt it prudent to include a solution (and this also provides a safe mechanism to get the source mount for the `/dev/console` bind-mount issue at the beginning of this advisory).&#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###&#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:&#xA;&#xA;  * CVE-2025-31133&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52881&#xA;  * CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset. The following patches from that patchset resolve the issues in this advisory:&#xA;&#xA; * db19bbed5348 (&#34;internal/sys: add VerifyInode helper&#34;)&#xA; * ff94f9991bd3 (&#34;*: switch to safer securejoin.Reopen&#34;)&#xA; * 531ef794e4ec (&#34;console: use TIOCGPTPEER when allocating peer PTY&#34;)&#xA; * 398955bccb7f (&#34;console: add fallback for pre-TIOCGPTPEER kernels&#34;)&#xA; * 9be1dbf4ac67 (&#34;console: avoid trivial symlink attacks for /dev/console&#34;)&#xA; * de87203e625c (&#34;console: verify /dev/pts/ptmx before use&#34;)&#xA; * 01de9d65dc72 (&#34;rootfs: avoid using os.Create for new device inodes&#34;)&#xA; * aee7d3fe355d (&#34;ci: add lint to forbid the usage of os.Create&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;runc 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3 have been released and all contain fixes for these issues. As per [runc&#39;s new release model](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md), runc 1.1.x and earlier are no longer supported and thus have not been patched.&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2&#xA;[CVE-2025-52565]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r&#xA;[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm&#xA;[RELEASES.md]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md&#xA;&#xA;### Mitigations ###&#xA;* Use containers with user namespaces (with the host root user not mapped into the container&#39;s user namespace). This will block most of the most serious aspects of these attacks, as the `procfs` files used for the container breakout use Unix DAC permissions and user namespaced users will not have access to the relevant files. &#xA;&#xA;An attacker would still be able to bind-mount host paths into the container but if the host uids and gids mapped into the container do not overlap with ordinary users on the host (which is the generally recommended configuration) then the attacker would likely not be able to read or write to most sensitive host files (depending on the Unix DAC permissions of the host files). Note that this is still technically more privilege than an unprivileged user on the host -- because the bind-mount is done by a privileged process, the attacker would be able to get access to directories whose parents may have denied search access (i.e., they may be able to access paths inside a `chmod 700` directory that would normally block them from resolving subpaths). &#xA;&#xA;Runc would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that runc **strongly** recommend all users use user namespaced containers. They have proven to be one of the best security hardening mechanisms against container breakouts, and the kernel applies additional restrictions to user namespaced containers above and beyond the user remapping functionality provided. With the advent of id-mapped mounts (Linux 5.12), there is very little reason to not use user namespaces for most applications. Note that using user namespaces to configure your container does not mean you have to enable unprivileged user namespace creation *inside* the container -- most container runtimes apply a seccomp-bpf profile which blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` inside containers regardless of whether the container itself uses user namespaces. &#xA;&#xA;Rootless containers can provide even more protection if your configuration can use them -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. &#xA;&#xA; * For non-user namespaced containers, configure all containers you spawn to not permit processes to run with root privileges. In most cases this would require configuring the container to use a non-root user and enabling `noNewPrivileges` to disable any setuid or set-capability binaries. (Note that this is runc&#39;s general recommendation for a secure container setup -- it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an untrusted program with root privileges safely.) If you need to use `ping` in your containers, there is a `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl that can be used to allow unprivileged users to ping without requiring setuid or set-capability binaries. &#xA; * Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.&#xA; * The default `containers-selinux` SELinux policy mitigates this issue, as (unlike CVE-2025-31133) the `/dev/console` bind-mount does not get relabeled and so the container process cannot write to the bind-mounted procfs file by default.&#xA;&#xA;   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so this mitigation is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.&#xA;&#xA; * The default AppArmor policy used by Docker and Podman does not mitigate this issue (as access to `/dev/console`) is usually permitted. Users could create a custom profile that blocks access to `/dev/console`, but such a profile might break regular containers.&#xA;&#xA;   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so the mitigation provided with a custom profile is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.&#xA;&#xA;[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2&#xA;[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm&#xA;&#xA;### Other Runtimes ###&#xA;As this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug,runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability.&#xA;&#xA;Based on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a co-ordinated security release along with runc. LXC appears to also be vulnerable in some aspects, but [their security stance][lxc-security] is (understandably) that non-user-namespaced containers are fundamentally insecure by design.&#xA;&#xA;[lxc-security]: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/&#xA;&#xA;### Credits ###&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) and Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering and reporting the main `/dev/console` bind-mount vulnerability, as well as Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) for discovering Issues 1 and 2 and the original research into these classes of issues several years ago.</description>

      <title>runc container escape via &#34;masked path&#34; abuse due to mount race conditions</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2</link>
      <description>### Impact ###  &#xA;The OCI runtime specification has a `maskedPaths` feature that allows for files or directories to be &#34;masked&#34; by placing a mount on top of them to conceal their contents. This is primarily intended to protect against privileged users in non-user-namespaced from being able to write to files or access directories that would either provide sensitive information about the host to containers or allow containers to perform destructive or other privileged operations on the host (examples include `/proc/kcore`, `/proc/timer_list`, `/proc/acpi`, and `/proc/keys`).  &#xA;&#xA;`maskedPaths` can be used to either mask a directory or a file -- directories are masked using a new read-only `tmpfs` instance that is mounted on top of the masked path, while files are masked by bind-mounting the container&#39;s `/dev/null` on top of the masked path.  &#xA;&#xA;In all known versions of runc, when using the container&#39;s `/dev/null` to mask files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container&#39;s `/dev/null`) was actually a real `/dev/null` inode. While `/dev/null` is usually created by runc when doing container creation, it is possible for an attacker to create a `/dev/null` or modify the `/dev/null` inode created by runc through race conditions with other containers sharing mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured).  &#xA;&#xA;This could lead to two separate issues:  &#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 1: Arbitrary Mount Gadget (leading to Host Information Disclosure, Host Denial of Service, or Container Escape) ####  &#xA;By replacing `/dev/null` with a symlink to an attacker-controlled path, an attacker could cause runc to bind-mount an arbitrary source path to a path inside the container. This could lead to:  &#xA;* **Host Denial of Service**: By bind-mounting files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger`, the attacker can gain access to a read-write version of files which can be destructive to write to (`/proc/sysrq-trigger` would allow an attacker to trigger a kernel panic, shutting down the machine, or causing the machine to freeze without rebooting).  &#xA;* **Container Escape**: By bind-mounting `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`, the attacker can reconfigure a coredump helper -- as kernel upcalls are not namespaced, the configured binary (which could be a container binary or a host binary with a malicious command-line) will run with full privileges on the host system. Thus, the attacker can simply trigger a coredump and gain complete root privileges over the host.  &#xA;&#xA;Note that while `config.json` allows users to bind-mount arbitrary paths (and thus an attacker that can modify `config.json` arbitrarily could gain the same access as this exploit), because `maskedPaths` is applied by almost all higher-level container runtimes (and thus provides a guaranteed mount source) this flaw effectively allows any attacker that can spawn containers (with some degree of control over what kinds of containers are being spawned) to achieve the above goals. &#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 2: Bypassing `maskedPaths` ####  &#xA;While investigating Attack 1, runc discovered that the runc validation mechanism when bind-mounting `/dev/null` for `maskedPaths` would ignore `ENOENT` errors -- meaning that if an attacker deleted `/dev/null` before runc did the bind-mount, runc would silently skip applying `maskedPaths` for the container. (The original purpose of this `ENOENT`-ignore behaviour was to permit configurations where `maskedPaths` references non-existent files, but runc did not consider that the source path could also not exist in this kind of race-attack scenario.)  &#xA;&#xA;With `maskedPaths` rendered inoperative, an attacker would be able to access sensitive host information from files in `/proc` that would usually be masked (such as `/proc/kcore`). However, note that `/proc/sys` and `/proc/sysrq-trigger` are mounted read-only rather than being masked with files, so this attack variant will not allow the same breakout or host denial of service attacks as in Attack 1. &#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###  &#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:  &#xA;* CVE-2025-31133&#xA;* CVE-2025-52881&#xA;* CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

This will block most of the most serious aspects of these attacks, as the `procfs` files used for the container breakout use Unix DAC permissions and user namespaced users will not have access to the relevant files.&#xA;&#xA;  runc would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that runc **strongly** recommend all users use user namespaced containers. They have proven to be one of the best security hardening mechanisms against container breakouts, and the kernel applies additional restrictions to user namespaced containers above and beyond the user remapping functionality provided. With the advent of id-mapped mounts (Linux 5.12), there is very little reason to not use user namespaces for most applications. Note that using user namespaces to configure your container does not mean you have to enable unprivileged user namespace creation *inside* the container -- most container runtimes apply a seccomp-bpf profile which blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` inside containers regardless of whether the container itself uses user namespaces.&#xA;&#xA;  Rootless containers can provide even more protection if your configuration can use them -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. &#xA;&#xA;- For non-user namespaced containers, configure all containers you spawn to not permit processes to run with root privileges. In most cases this would require configuring the container to use a non-root user and enabling `noNewPrivileges` to disable any setuid or set-capability binaries. (Note that this is runc&#39;s general recommendation for a secure container setup -- it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an untrusted program with root privileges safely.) If you need to use `ping` in your containers, there is a `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl that can be used to allow unprivileged users to ping without requiring setuid or set-capability binaries.  &#xA; - Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.  &#xA; - Depending on the configuration of `maskedPaths`, an AppArmor profile (such as the default one applied by higher level runtimes including Docker and Podman) can block write attempts to most of `/proc` and `/sys`. This means that even with a procfs file maliciously bind-mounted to a `maskedPaths` target, all of the targets of `maskedPaths` in the default configuration of runtimes such as Docker or Podman will still not permit write access to said files. However, if a container is configured with a `maskedPaths` that is not protected by AppArmor then the same attack can be carried out. Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so this mitigation is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.  &#xA; - Based on runc&#39;s analysis, SELinux policies have a limited effect when trying to protect against this attack. The reason is that the `/dev/null` bind-mount gets implicitly relabelled with `context=...` set to the container&#39;s SELinux context, and thus the container process will have access to the source of the bind-mount even if they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.  &#xA;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm  &#xA;&#xA;### Other Runtimes ###  &#xA;As this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug, runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability. Based on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a coordinated security release along with runc. LXC appears to also be vulnerable in some aspects, but [their security stance](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/) is (understandably) that non-user-namespaced containers are fundamentally insecure by design.  &#xA;https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/  &#xA;&#xA;### Credits ###  &#xA;Thanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) for finding and reporting the original vulnerability (Attack 1), and Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering another attack vector (Attack 2) based on @ssst0n3&#39;s initial findings.</description>

      <title>runc container escape via &#34;masked path&#34; abuse due to mount race conditions</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2</link>
      <description>### Impact ###  &#xA;The OCI runtime specification has a `maskedPaths` feature that allows for files or directories to be &#34;masked&#34; by placing a mount on top of them to conceal their contents. This is primarily intended to protect against privileged users in non-user-namespaced from being able to write to files or access directories that would either provide sensitive information about the host to containers or allow containers to perform destructive or other privileged operations on the host (examples include `/proc/kcore`, `/proc/timer_list`, `/proc/acpi`, and `/proc/keys`).  &#xA;&#xA;`maskedPaths` can be used to either mask a directory or a file -- directories are masked using a new read-only `tmpfs` instance that is mounted on top of the masked path, while files are masked by bind-mounting the container&#39;s `/dev/null` on top of the masked path.  &#xA;&#xA;In all known versions of runc, when using the container&#39;s `/dev/null` to mask files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container&#39;s `/dev/null`) was actually a real `/dev/null` inode. While `/dev/null` is usually created by runc when doing container creation, it is possible for an attacker to create a `/dev/null` or modify the `/dev/null` inode created by runc through race conditions with other containers sharing mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured).  &#xA;&#xA;This could lead to two separate issues:  &#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 1: Arbitrary Mount Gadget (leading to Host Information Disclosure, Host Denial of Service, or Container Escape) ####  &#xA;By replacing `/dev/null` with a symlink to an attacker-controlled path, an attacker could cause runc to bind-mount an arbitrary source path to a path inside the container. This could lead to:  &#xA;* **Host Denial of Service**: By bind-mounting files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger`, the attacker can gain access to a read-write version of files which can be destructive to write to (`/proc/sysrq-trigger` would allow an attacker to trigger a kernel panic, shutting down the machine, or causing the machine to freeze without rebooting).  &#xA;* **Container Escape**: By bind-mounting `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`, the attacker can reconfigure a coredump helper -- as kernel upcalls are not namespaced, the configured binary (which could be a container binary or a host binary with a malicious command-line) will run with full privileges on the host system. Thus, the attacker can simply trigger a coredump and gain complete root privileges over the host.  &#xA;&#xA;Note that while `config.json` allows users to bind-mount arbitrary paths (and thus an attacker that can modify `config.json` arbitrarily could gain the same access as this exploit), because `maskedPaths` is applied by almost all higher-level container runtimes (and thus provides a guaranteed mount source) this flaw effectively allows any attacker that can spawn containers (with some degree of control over what kinds of containers are being spawned) to achieve the above goals. &#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 2: Bypassing `maskedPaths` ####  &#xA;While investigating Attack 1, runc discovered that the runc validation mechanism when bind-mounting `/dev/null` for `maskedPaths` would ignore `ENOENT` errors -- meaning that if an attacker deleted `/dev/null` before runc did the bind-mount, runc would silently skip applying `maskedPaths` for the container. (The original purpose of this `ENOENT`-ignore behaviour was to permit configurations where `maskedPaths` references non-existent files, but runc did not consider that the source path could also not exist in this kind of race-attack scenario.)  &#xA;&#xA;With `maskedPaths` rendered inoperative, an attacker would be able to access sensitive host information from files in `/proc` that would usually be masked (such as `/proc/kcore`). However, note that `/proc/sys` and `/proc/sysrq-trigger` are mounted read-only rather than being masked with files, so this attack variant will not allow the same breakout or host denial of service attacks as in Attack 1. &#xA;&#xA;### Patches ###  &#xA;This advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:  &#xA;* CVE-2025-31133&#xA;* CVE-2025-52881&#xA;* CVE-2025-52565&#xA;&#xA;The patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

      <description>### Impact&#xA;runc 1.1.13 and earlier as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier can be tricked into&#xA;creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host&#xA;filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race&#xA;with os.MkdirAll. While this can be used to create empty files, existing&#xA;files **will not** be truncated.&#xA;&#xA;An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom&#xA;volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but&#xA;the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced.&#xA;Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block&#xA;this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict&#xA;this attack&#39;s scope but the exact scope of protection hasn&#39;t been analysed.&#xA;&#xA;This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and&#xA;Kubernetes.&#xA;&#xA;The CVSS score for this vulnerability is&#xA;CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low severity, 3.6).&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the&#xA;attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root&#xA;user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual&#xA;user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don&#39;t use&#xA;/etc/sub[ug]id), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to&#xA;create inodes in world-writable directories.&#xA;&#xA;A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the&#xA;scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though we haven&#39;t&#xA;thoroughly tested to what extent the standard existing policies block this&#xA;attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;Fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.&#xA;&#xA;* `main` patches:&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4359&#xA;  *  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/63c2908164f3a1daea455bf5bcd8d363d70328c7&#xA;* `release-1.1` patches:&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/8781993968fd964ac723ff5f360b6f259e809a3e&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f0b652ea61ff6750a8fcc69865d45a7abf37accf&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;Thanks to Rodrigo Campos Catelin (@rata) and Alban Crequy (@alban) from&#xA;Microsoft for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.</description>

Unless the root user is remapped to an actual&#xA;user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don&#39;t use&#xA;/etc/sub[ug]id), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to&#xA;create inodes in world-writable directories.&#xA;&#xA;A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the&#xA;scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though we haven&#39;t&#xA;thoroughly tested to what extent the standard existing policies block this&#xA;attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;Fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.&#xA;&#xA;* `main` patches:&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4359&#xA;  *  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/63c2908164f3a1daea455bf5bcd8d363d70328c7&#xA;* `release-1.1` patches:&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/8781993968fd964ac723ff5f360b6f259e809a3e&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f0b652ea61ff6750a8fcc69865d45a7abf37accf&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;Thanks to Rodrigo Campos Catelin (@rata) and Alban Crequy (@alban) from&#xA;Microsoft for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>runc vulnerable to container breakout through process.cwd trickery and leaked fds</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (&#34;attack 2&#34;). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (&#34;attack 1&#34;). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (&#34;attack 3a&#34; and &#34;attack 3b&#34;).&#xA;&#xA;Strictly speaking, while attack 3a is the most severe from a CVSS perspective, attacks 2 and 3b are arguably more dangerous in practice because they allow for a breakout from inside a container as opposed to requiring a user execute a malicious image. The reason attacks 1 and 3a are scored higher is because being able to socially engineer users is treated as a given for UI:R vectors, despite attacks 2 and 3b requiring far more minimal user interaction (just reasonable `runc exec` operations on a container the attacker has access to). In any case, all four attacks can lead to full control of the host system.&#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 1: `process.cwd` &#34;mis-configuration&#34;&#xA;&#xA;In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked internally within runc into `runc init`, including a handle to the host&#39;s `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, prior to runc 1.1.12, runc also did not verify that the final working directory was inside the container&#39;s mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it was incorrectly assumed there would be no way to chdir outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).&#xA;&#xA;The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.2, high severity).&#xA;&#xA;Note that this attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).&#xA;&#xA;#### Attack 2: `runc exec` container breakout&#xA;&#xA;(This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)&#xA;&#xA;The same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.&#xA;&#xA;`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).&#xA;&#xA;The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (7.2, high severity).&#xA;&#xA;#### Attacks 3a and 3b: `process.args` host binary overwrite attack&#xA;&#xA;(These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)&#xA;&#xA;Attacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in CVE-2019-5736 (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.&#xA;&#xA;For the purposes of CVSS scoring:&#xA;&#xA;* Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.6, high severity).&#xA;* Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.2, high severity).&#xA;&#xA;As mentioned in attack 1, while 3b is scored lower it is more dangerous in practice as it doesn&#39;t require a user to run a malicious image.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;runc 1.1.12 has been released, and includes patches for this issue. Note that there are four separate fixes applied:&#xA;&#xA;* Checking that the working directory is actually inside the container by checking whether `os.Getwd` returns `ENOENT` (Linux provides a way of detecting if cwd is outside the current namespace root). This explicitly blocks runc from executing a container process when inside a non-container path and thus eliminates attacks 1 and 2 even in the case of fd leaks.&#xA;* Close all internal runc file descriptors in the final stage of `runc init`, right before `execve`. This ensures that internal file descriptors cannot be used as an argument to `execve` and thus eliminates attacks 3a and 3b, even in the case of fd leaks. This requires hooking into some Go runtime internals to make sure we don&#39;t close critical Go internal file descriptors.&#xA;* Fixing the specific fd leaks that made these bug exploitable (mark `/sys/fs/cgroup` as `O_CLOEXEC` and backport a fix for some `*os.File` leaks).&#xA;* In order to protect against future `runc init` file descriptor leaks, mark all non-stdio files as `O_CLOEXEC` before executing `runc init`.&#xA;&#xA;### Other Runtimes&#xA;&#xA;We have discovered that several other container runtimes are either potentially vulnerable to similar attacks, or do not have sufficient protection against attacks of this nature. We recommend other container runtime authors look at [our patches](#Patches) and make sure they at least add a `getcwd() != ENOENT` check as well as consider whether `close_range(3, UINT_MAX, CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC)` before executing their equivalent of `runc init` is appropriate.&#xA;&#xA; * crun 1.12 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell), but no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `crun` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `crun` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.&#xA; * youki 0.3.1 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell) however this appears to be pure luck. `youki` does leak a directory file descriptor from the host mount namespace, but it just so happens that the directory is the rootfs of the container (which then gets `pivot_root`&#39;d into and so ends up as a in-root path thanks to `chroot_fs_refs`). In addition, no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `youki` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `youki` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.&#xA; * LXC 5.0.3 does not appear to leak any useful file descriptors, and they have comments noting the importance of not leaking file descriptors in `lxc-attach`. However, they don&#39;t seem to have any proactive protection against file descriptor leaks at the point of `chdir` such as using `close_range(...)` (they do have RAII-like `__do_fclose` closers but those don&#39;t necessarily stop all leaks in this context) nor do they have any check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. Unfortunately it seems they cannot use `CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC` because they don&#39;t need to re-exec themselves.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container&#39;s mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).&#xA;&#xA;For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.&#xA;&#xA;For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary you try to execute with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.&#xA;&#xA;### See Also&#xA;* https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21626&#xA;* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12&#xA;* The runc 1.1.12 merge commit https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/a9833ff391a71b30069a6c3f816db113379a4346, which contains the following security patches:&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/506552a88bd3455e80a9b3829568e94ec0160309&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0994249a5ec4e363bfcf9af58a87a722e9a3a31b&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/fbe3eed1e568a376f371d2ced1b4ac16b7d7adde&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/284ba3057e428f8d6c7afcc3b0ac752e525957df&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/b6633f48a8c970433737b9be5bfe4f25d58a5aa7&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/683ad2ff3b01fb142ece7a8b3829de17150cf688&#xA;  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/e9665f4d606b64bf9c4652ab2510da368bfbd951&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Rory McNamara from Snyk for discovering and disclosing the original vulnerability (attack 1) to Docker, @lifubang from acmcoder for discovering how to adapt the attack to overwrite host binaries (attack 3a), and Aleksa Sarai from SUSE for discovering how to adapt the attacks to work as container breakouts using `runc exec` (attacks 2 and 3b).</description>

      <title>Overflow in netlink bytemsg length field allows attacker to override netlink-based container configuration in RunC</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;In runc, [netlink](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html) is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the C portion of our code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration.&#xA;&#xA;This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces.&#xA;&#xA;Prior to 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554, in practice it was fairly difficult to specify an arbitrary-length netlink message with most container runtimes. The only user-controlled byte array was the namespace paths attributes which can be specified in runc&#39;s `config.json`, but as far as we can tell no container runtime gives raw access to that configuration setting -- and having raw access to that setting **would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely anyway** (setting them to `/proc/1/ns/...` for instance). In addition, each namespace path is limited to 4096 bytes (with only 7 namespaces supported by runc at the moment) meaning that even with custom namespace paths it appears an attacker still cannot shove enough bytes into the netlink bytemsg in order to overflow the uint16 counter.&#xA;&#xA;However, out of an abundance of caution (given how old this bug is) we decided to treat it as a potentially exploitable vulnerability with a low severity. After 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554 (which was not present in any release of runc prior to the discovery of this bug), all mount paths are included as a giant netlink message which means that this bug becomes significantly more exploitable in more reasonable threat scenarios.&#xA;&#xA;The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure), though as mentioned above it appears this bug was not practically exploitable on any released version of runc to date.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;The patch for this is d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae and runc 1.0.3 was released with this bug fixed.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;To the extent this is exploitable, disallowing untrusted namespace paths in container configuration should eliminate all practical ways of exploiting this bug. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;* commit d72d057ba794 (&#34;runc init: avoid netlink message length overflows&#34;)&#xA;* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;Thanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. In particular, the fact they found this vulnerability so quickly, before we made a 1.1 release of runc (which would&#39;ve been vulnerable) was quite impressive.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;* Open an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)&#xA;</description>

      <title>opencontainers runc contains procfs race condition with a shared volume mount</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fh74-hm69-rqjw</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;By crafting a malicious root filesystem (with `/proc` being a symlink to a directory which was inside a volume shared with another running container), an attacker in control of both containers can trick `runc` into not correctly configuring the container&#39;s security labels and not correctly masking paths inside `/proc` which contain potentially-sensitive information about the host (or even allow for direct attacks against the host).&#xA;&#xA;In order to exploit this bug, an untrusted user must be able to spawn custom containers with custom mount configurations (such that a volume is shared between two containers). It should be noted that we consider this to be a fairly high level of access for an untrusted user -- and we do not recommend allowing completely untrusted users to have such degrees of access without further restrictions.&#xA;&#xA;### Specific Go Package Affected&#xA;github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;This vulnerability has been fixed in `1.0.0-rc10`. It should be noted that the current fix is effectively a hot-fix, and there are known ways for it to be worked around (such as making the entire root filesystem a shared volume controlled by another container). We recommend that users review their access policies to ensure that untrusted users do not have such high levels of controls over container mount configuration.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to configure mountpoints for `runc` (or through a higher-level tool such as `docker run -v`) then you are not vulnerable to this issue. This exploit requires fairly complicated levels of access (which are available for some public clouds but are not necessarily available for all deployments).&#xA;&#xA;Additionally, it appears as though it is not possible to exploit this vulnerability through Docker (due to the order of mounts Docker generates). However you should not depend on this, as it may be possible to work around this roadblock.&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;This vulnerability was discovered by Cure53, as part of a third-party security audit.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;* [Open an issue](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/new).&#xA;* Email us at [dev@opencontainers.org](mailto:dev@opencontainers.org), or [security@opencontainers.org](mailto:security@opencontainers.org) if you think you&#39;ve found a security bug.</description>

      <description>### Impact&#xA;Contrary to the [OCI runtime specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config-linux.md#device-whitelist), `runc`&#39;s implementation of the `linux.resources.devices` list was a black-list by default. This means that users who created their own `config.json` objects and didn&#39;t prefix a deny-all rule (`{&#34;allow&#34;: false, &#34;permissions&#34;: &#34;rwm&#34;}` or equivalent) were not provided protection by the `devices` cgroup. This would allow malicious containers (with sufficient privileges) to create arbitrary device inodes (assuming they have `CAP_MKNOD`) and operate on any device inodes they may have access to (assuming they have regular Unix DAC permissions).&#xA;&#xA;However, most (if not all) programs that make use of `runc` include this deny-all rule. This was most likely added before the specification mandated a white-list of devices, and the fact that all programs wrote their own deny-all rule obscured the existence of this bug for several years. In fact, even the specification&#39;s examples include a default deny-all rule! We therefore believe that while this is a security bug (and has been fixed as such), it was almost certainly not exploitable in the wild due to the inclusion of default deny-all rules by all known users of `runc` -- hence why this advisory has low severity.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;This issue has been fixed in [a patch that was part of a larger rework of the devices cgroup code in runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391) -- which lead to the discovery of this security bug. Users should upgrade to 1.0.0-rc91 as soon as it is released, or wait for your distribution to backport the relevant fixes.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;If you are using `runc` directly, ensure that there is a deny-all entry at the beginning of `linux.resources.devices` -- such an entry would look like `{&#34;allow&#34;: false, &#34;permissions&#34;: &#34;rwm&#34;}` (all other fields are ignored, though `type` must be set to `&#34;a&#34;` or `null` if it is present).&#xA;&#xA;Users which consume `runc` through another program should check whether their containers are operating under a white-list -- this can be done by reading `/sys/fs/cgroup/devices/devices.list` inside the container. If the file contains only the entry `a *:* rwm` (meaning the cgroup is in black-list mode, which likely means &#34;allow all device access&#34;) then your containers are vulnerable to this issue.&#xA;&#xA;As always, we recommend **in the strongest possible terms** that all of our users enable user namespaces on all of their workloads (or pressure their vendors to do so). User namespaces are one of the most significant defense-in-depth protections you can enable for containers, and have prevented many container-related vulnerabilities (both kernel 0days as well as bugs in container runtimes, such as this one).&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;* https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/devices.html&#xA;* [opencontainers/runtime-spec/config-linux.md#device-whitelist](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config-linux.md#device-whitelist)&#xA;* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;* [Open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/new).&#xA;* Email us at &lt;security@opencontainers.org&gt;.</description>

      <title>mount destinations can be swapped via symlink-exchange to cause mounts outside the rootfs</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r</link>
      <description>### Summary&#xA;&#xA;runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby&#xA;an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that&#xA;actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container&#xA;(allowing for a container escape). CVE-2021-30465 has been assigned for this&#xA;issue.&#xA;&#xA;An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom&#xA;volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such&#xA;as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of&#xA;damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a&#xA;reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions&#xA;Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.&#xA;&#xA;The now-released [runc v1.0.0-rc95][release] contains a fix for this issue, we&#xA;recommend users update as soon as possible.&#xA;&#xA;[release]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95&#xA;&#xA;### Details&#xA;&#xA;In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting&#xA;inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a&#xA;symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the&#xA;container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a&#xA;time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to&#xA;previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with&#xA;libpathrs).&#xA;&#xA;However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace&#xA;with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn&#39;t&#xA;appear on the host -- it&#39;s only a &#34;host-side mount&#34; inside the container&#39;s&#xA;namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the&#xA;configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source&#xA;for a subsequent mount.&#xA;&#xA;However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --&#xA;though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar&#xA;behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume&#xA;management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to&#xA;the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary&#xA;control over container configuration.&#xA;&#xA;In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a&#xA;volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from&#xA;(for instance,&#xA;`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then&#xA;using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an&#xA;attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which&#xA;subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the&#xA;attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory&#xA;with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will&#xA;bind-mount `/` into the container.&#xA;&#xA;Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly&#xA;peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as&#xA;bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious&#xA;code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It&#xA;helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,&#xA;though this is not a hard requirement.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;This has been patched in runc 1.0.0-rc95, and users should upgrade as soon as&#xA;possible. The patch itself can be found [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f).&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;There are no known workarounds for this issue.&#xA;&#xA;However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security&#xA;profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the&#xA;container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what&#xA;an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users&#xA;make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces&#xA;-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the&#xA;host system).&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;* [commit](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f)&#xA;* [seclists public disclosure](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2)&#xA;&#xA;### Credit&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Etienne Champetier for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability,&#xA;to Noah Meyerhans for writing the first draft of this patch, and to Samuel Karp&#xA;for testing it.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;* Open an issue in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues).&#xA;* Email us at &lt;security@opencontainers.org&gt;.</description>

      <title>Information Exposure in RunC</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gp4j-w3vj-7299</link>
      <description>RunC allowed additional container processes via &#39;runc exec&#39; to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.</description>

      <title>Incorrect Authorization in imgcrypt</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8v99-48m9-c8pm</link>
      <description>Imgcrypt implements a function `CheckAuthorization()` that is supposed to check whether a user is authorized to access an encrypted image given the keys that the user has provided on the command line that would enable decryption of the image. The check is to prevent that a user can start a container from an image that has previously been decrypted by another user on the same system and therefore a decrypted version of the image layers may be already available in the cache locally.&#xA;&#xA;The failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. In the version prior to the fix, only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally (were not pulled) since it cannot be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run lead to other architectures in the ManifestList be able to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. The fixed version now skips over irrelevant architectures and tests the Manifest of the local architecture, if available.&#xA;&#xA;Known projects that use the `CheckAuthorization()` of imgcrypt is for example the ctr-enc client tool provided by imgcrypt. In this implementation, the call to `CheckAuthorization()` is used on the client side and could therefore also be easily circumvented by a modified client tool not calling this function.&#xA;&#xA;In relation to the vulnerability in ctr-enc, affected environments would have to allow different users to invoke ctr-enc indirectly using some sort of management stack that gives user indirect access to ctr-enc.&#xA;&#xA;The patch has been applied to imgcrypt v1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.</description>

      <title>CRI-O has Potential High Memory Consumption from File Read</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8f93-j3fx-72f3</link>
      <description>There&#39;s a vulnerability in the CRI-O application where when container is launched with securityContext.runAsUser specifying a non-existent user, CRI-O attempts to create the user, reading the container&#39;s entire /etc/passwd file into memory. If this file is excessively large, it can cause the a high memory consumption leading applications to be killed due to out-of-memory. As a result a denial-of-service can be achieved, possibly disrupting other pods and services running in the same host.</description>

      <description>### Impact&#xA;On CRI-O, it looks like an arbitrary systemd property can be injected via a Pod annotation:&#xA;```&#xA;---&#xA;apiVersion: v1&#xA;kind: Pod&#xA;metadata:&#xA;  name: poc-arbitrary-systemd-property-injection&#xA;  annotations:&#xA;    # I believe that ExecStart with an arbitrary command works here too,&#xA;    # but I haven&#39;t figured out how to marshalize the ExecStart struct to gvariant string.&#xA;    org.systemd.property.SuccessAction: &#34;&#39;poweroff-force&#39;&#34;&#xA;spec:&#xA;  containers:&#xA;    - name: hello&#xA;      image: [quay.io/podman/hello](http://quay.io/podman/hello)&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;This means that any user who can create a pod with an arbitrary annotation may perform an arbitrary action on the host system.&#xA;&#xA;Tested with CRI-O v1.24 on minikube.&#xA;I didn&#39;t test the latest v1.29 because it is incompatible with minikube: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/18367&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to Cédric Clerget (GitHub ID @cclerget) for finding out that CRI-O just passes pod annotations to OCI annotations:&#xA;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3923#discussion_r1532292536&#xA;&#xA;CRI-O has to filter out annotations that have the prefix &#34;org.systemd.property.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;See also:&#xA;- https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/features.md#unsafe-annotations-in-configjson&#xA;- https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4217&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;Unfortunately, the only workarounds would involve an external mutating webhook to disallow these annotations&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;&#xA;</description>

      <title>CRI-O vulnerable to /etc/passwd tampering resulting in Privilege Escalation</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cm9x-c3rh-7rc4</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;It is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines to add entries to a container&#39;s /etc/passwd. It is possible to circumvent admission validation of username/UID by adding such an entry.&#xA;&#xA;Note: because the pod author is in control of the container&#39;s /etc/passwd, this is not considered a new risk factor. However, this advisory is being opened for transparency and as a way of tracking fixes.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;1.26.0 will have the fix. More patches will be posted as they&#39;re available.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;Additional security controls like SELinux should prevent any damage a container is able to do with root on the host. Using SELinux is recommended because this class of attack is already possible by manually editing the container&#39;s /etc/passwd &#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;</description>

      <title>Node DOS by way of memory exhaustion through ExecSync request in CRI-O</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j</link>
      <description>### Description&#xA;An ExecSync request runs a command in a container and returns the output to the Kubelet. It is used for readiness and liveness probes within a pod. The way CRI-O runs ExecSync commands is through conmon. CRI-O asks conmon to start the process, and conmon writes the output to disk. CRI-O then reads the output and returns it to the Kubelet.&#xA;&#xA;If the output of the command is large enough, it is possible to exhaust the memory (or disk usage) of the node. The following deployment is an example yaml file that will output around 8GB of ‘A’ characters, which would be written to disk by conmon and read by CRI-O.&#xA;&#xA;```yaml&#xA;apiVersion: apps/v1&#xA;kind: Deployment&#xA;metadata:&#xA;  name: nginx-deployment100&#xA;spec:&#xA;  selector:&#xA;    matchLabels:&#xA;      app: nginx&#xA;  replicas: 2&#xA;  template:&#xA;    metadata:&#xA;      labels:&#xA;        app: nginx&#xA;    spec:&#xA;      containers:&#xA;      - name: nginx&#xA;        image: nginx:1.14.2&#xA;        lifecycle:&#xA;          postStart:&#xA;            exec:&#xA;              command: [&#34;/bin/sh&#34;, &#34;-c&#34;, &#34;seq 1 50000000`; do echo -n &#39;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&#39;; done&#34;]&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory or disk space, depending on the node the command is being run on. What is further problematic is that the memory and disk usage aren&#39;t attributed to the container, as this file and its processing are implementation details of CRI-O.

      <title>Incorrect Default Permissions in CRI-O</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4hj2-r2pm-3hc6</link>
      <description>### Impact&#xA;&#xA;A bug was found in CRI-O where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.  Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container&#39;s bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.&#xA;&#xA;This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container&#39;s bounding set.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;This bug will been fixed in the following versions of CRI-O:&#xA;- v1.24.0&#xA;&#xA;Users should update to the version corresponding to their minor release as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.&#xA;&#xA;This fix changes CRI-O behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container&#39;s bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container&#39;s bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container&#39;s bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;The entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.&#xA;&#xA;### Credits&#xA;&#xA;CRI-O would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue, as well as the Moby (Docker Engine) project for working with the other container engines in coordinating a fix.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:&#xA;&#xA;* [Open an issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/new)&#xA;* Email us at [cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io](cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io) if you think you’ve found a security bug&#xA;&#xA;------------------&#xA;&#xA;https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L&#xA;4.8/Medium&#xA;&#xA;|Metric&#x9;|Value&#x9;|Comments&#x9;|&#xA;|---&#x9;|---&#x9;|---&#x9;|&#xA;|Attack Vector (AV)&#x9;|Local&#x9;|An attacker requires local control to launch a container with files that have inheritable capabilities. &#x9;|&#xA;|Attack Complexity (AC)&#x9;|Low&#x9;|Modifying a file to have inheritable capabilities is not difficult.&#x9;|&#xA;|Privileges Required (PR)&#x9;|Low&#x9;|An attacker requires enough privilege to cause a container to be launched with a compromised image.

      <title>CoreDNS: DNS Cache Pinning via etcd Lease ID Confusion</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-93mf-426m-g6x9</link>
      <description># Summary&#xA;&#xA;The CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling cache pinning for very long periods. This can effectively cause a denial of service for DNS updates/changes to affected services.&#xA;&#xA;# Details&#xA;&#xA;In `plugin/etcd/etcd.go`, the `TTL()` function casts the 64-bit etcd lease ID to a uint32 and uses it as the TTL:&#xA;&#xA;```go&#xA;func (e *Etcd) TTL(kv *mvccpb.KeyValue, serv *msg.Service) uint32 {&#xA;    etcdTTL := uint32(kv.Lease)  // BUG: Lease ID != TTL duration&#xA;    // ... rest of function uses etcdTTL as actual TTL&#xA;}&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;Lease IDs are identifiers, not durations. Large lease IDs can produce very large TTLs after truncation, causing downstream resolvers and clients to cache answers for years.&#xA;&#xA;This enables cache pinning attacks, such as:&#xA;&#xA;1. Attacker has etcd write access (compromised service account, misconfigured RBAC/TLS, exposed etcd, insider).&#xA;2. Attacker writes/updates a key and attaches any lease (the actual lease duration is irrelevant; the ID is misused).&#xA;4. CoreDNS serves the record with an extreme TTL; downstream resolvers/clients cache it for a very long time.&#xA;5. Even after fixing/deleting the key (or restarting CoreDNS), clients continue to use the cached answer until their caches expire or enforce their own TTL caps.&#xA;&#xA;Some resolvers implement TTL caps, but values and defaults vary widely and are not guaranteed.&#xA;&#xA;# PoC&#xA;&#xA;1. Launch etcd:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;etcd \&#xA;  --data-dir ./etcd-data \&#xA;  --listen-client-urls http://127.0.0.1:2379 \&#xA;  --advertise-client-urls http://127.0.0.1:2379 \&#xA;  --listen-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:2380 \&#xA;  --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:2380 \&#xA;  --initial-cluster default=http://127.0.0.1:2380 \&#xA;  --name default \&#xA;  --initial-cluster-token etcd-ttl-poc \&#xA;  --initial-cluster-state new &amp;&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;2. Prepare CoreDNS configuration:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;cat &gt; Corefile &lt;&lt; &#39;EOF&#39;&#xA;skydns.local {&#xA;    etcd {&#xA;        path /skydns&#xA;        endpoint http://localhost:2379&#xA;        debug&#xA;    }&#xA;    log&#xA;    errors&#xA;}&#xA;EOF&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;3. Launch CoreDNS:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;coredns -conf Corefile -dns.port=1053&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;4. Create an etcd record called `large-lease-service` with a lease grant of 1 hour:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;LEASE_ID=$(etcdctl --endpoints=http://127.0.0.1:2379 lease grant 3600 | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;)&#xA;&#xA;etcdctl --endpoints=http://127.0.0.1:2379 put /skydns/local/skydns/large-lease-service &#39;{&#xA;  &#34;host&#34;: &#34;192.168.1.101&#34;,&#xA;  &#34;port&#34;: 8080&#xA;}&#39; --lease=$LEASE_ID&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;7. Verify the lease details:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;$ etcdctl lease timetolive $LEASE_ID&#xA;lease 7c4a98dd35b75c23 granted with TTL(3600s), remaining(3252s)&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;8. Query the DNS record and observe the record TTL at 28 years:&#xA;&#xA;```bash&#xA;$ dig +noall +answer @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 large-lease-service.skydns.local A&#xA;large-lease-service.skydns.local. 901209123 IN A 192.168.1.101&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;# Impact&#xA;&#xA;Affects any CoreDNS deployment using the etcd plugin for service discovery.&#xA;&#xA;- Availability: High as service changes (IP rotations, failovers, rollbacks) may be ignored for extended periods by caches.&#xA;- Integrity: Low as stale/incorrect answers persist abnormally long. (Note: attacker with etcd write could already point to malicious endpoints; the bug magnifies persistence.)&#xA;- Confidentiality: None.&#xA;&#xA;The bug was introduced in #1702 as part of the CoreDNS [v1.2.0 release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.2.0).&#xA;&#xA;# Mitigation&#xA;&#xA;The TTL function should utilise etcd&#39;s Lease API to determine the proper TTL for leased records. Add configurable limits for minimum and maximum TTL when passing lease records, to clamp potentially extreme TTL values set as lease grant.&#xA;&#xA;# Credit&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to [@thevilledev](https://github.com/thevilledev) for disclovering this vulnerability and contributing a fix.&#xA;&#xA;# For more information&#xA;&#xA;Please consult our [security guide](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding our security process.</description>

      <title>CoreDNS Vulnerable to DoQ Memory Exhaustion via Stream Amplification</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cvx7-x8pj-x2gw</link>
      <description>### Summary&#xA;&#xA;A **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability was discovered in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments.&#xA;&#xA;### Impact&#xA;&#xA;- **Component**: `server_quic.go`&#xA;- **Attack Vector**: Remote, network-based&#xA;- **Attack Complexity**: Low&#xA;- **Privileges Required**: None&#xA;- **User Interaction**: None&#xA;- **Impact**: High availability loss (OOM kill or unresponsiveness)&#xA;&#xA;This issue affects deployments with `quic://` enabled in the Corefile. A single attacker can cause the CoreDNS instance to become unresponsive using minimal bandwidth and CPU.&#xA;&#xA;### Patches&#xA;&#xA;The patch introduces two key mitigation mechanisms:&#xA;&#xA;- **`max_streams`**: Caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection. Default: `256`.&#xA;- **`worker_pool_size`**: Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams. Default: `1024`.&#xA;&#xA;This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency. The new configuration options are exposed through the `quic` Corefile block:&#xA;&#xA;```&#xA;quic {&#xA;    max_streams 256&#xA;    worker_pool_size 1024&#xA;}&#xA;```&#xA;&#xA;These defaults are generous and aligned with typical DNS-over-QUIC client behavior.&#xA;&#xA;### Workarounds&#xA;&#xA;If you&#39;re unable to upgrade immediately, you can:&#xA;- Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in your Corefile&#xA;- Use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage&#xA;- Monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies&#xA;&#xA;### References&#xA;&#xA;- [RFC 9250 - DNS over Dedicated QUIC Connections](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9250)&#xA;- [quic-go GitHub project](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go)&#xA;- [QUIC stream exhaustion class of vulnerabilities (related)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/botella)&#xA;&#xA;### Credit&#xA;&#xA;Thanks to [@thevilledev](https://github.com/thevilledev) for disclovering this vulnerability and contributing a high-quality fix.&#xA;&#xA;### For more information&#xA;&#xA;Please consult our [security guide](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding our security process.</description>

      <title>CoreDNS vulnerable to TuDoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hfmw-7g3m-gj6q</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered in CoreDNS through 1.10.1. There is a vulnerability in DNS resolving software, which triggers a resolver to ignore valid responses, thus causing denial of service for normal resolution. In an exploit, the attacker could just forge a response targeting the source port of a vulnerable resolver without the need to guess the correct TXID.</description>

      <title>Improper Input Validation in Buildah and Podman</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fhqq-8f65-5xfc</link>
      <description>A vulnerability exists in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction. The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction. This issue can be exploited to mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process and, in some cases, modify the contents of those mounted files. Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files.</description>

      <title>Podman vulnerable to memory-based denial of service</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rpcc-p8xm-rc6p</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Podman. This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container&#39;s cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.</description>

      <title>Podman has Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties</title>
      <link>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vmhj-p9hw-vgrf</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Podman where it incorrectly allows containers when created to overwrite existing files in volumes, even if they are mounted as read-only. When a user runs a malicious container or a container based on a malicious image with an attached volume that is used for the first time, it is possible to trigger the flaw and overwrite files in the volume. This issue was introduced in version 1.6.0.</description>
